Module Name: AUTHHLP
Abstract: NTLM Authentication for telnetd.

/****************************************************************************
 USAGE

 Call AuthHelpValidateUser(A/W), depending on whether the user name and 
 password are in ANSI or UNICODE strings.  The ACL is always in UNICODE
 in CE because it is typically read from the registry.  The function will
 return TRUE if access is allowed and FALSE if it is not allowed.

 Access may be denied if the user is not a valid user on the domain, or 
 if they are not in the Access Control List (ACL).  
 The ACL is a string, each element separeted by a semicolon, that specifies
 the name of a group or user to either allow or deny service to.  To specify
 a group, put a "@" immediatly before it.  To specify either a user or a group
 is to be denied access, put a "-" before it.  

 
 For instance, ACL = "good_user1; @good_group1; -bad_user1; -@bad_group1; good_user2"
 will allow users named good_user1, good_user2, and anyone who is a member of
 the group good_group1 access (assuming they've succesfully been authenticated
 by NTLM).  It will deny access to anyone named bad_user1 and in bad_group1.

 The checks are made from left to right, and the check will stop being made
 as soon as a match (either positive or negative) is made.

 In the above example, if good_user1 is also a member of bad_group1, they will
 receive access because good_user1 came before bad_group1.  However, if
 good_user2 is a member of bad_group1, they will be denied access because 
 bad_group1 came before good_user2.
 
 A "*" in the ACL list means that all users are granted access, provided they 
 have not been disqualified by any of the arguments to the left of the arg
 list.

 For instance, if ACL = "-bad_user1; *" then all users will be granted
 access, except for bad_user1.
 

 IMPORTANT SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

 Note that there is some danger in using this API set over a public network
 such as the Internet if the passwords are not encrypted by the calling 
 application.  It is possible for a malicious user to intercept packets sent 
 to  your network application and to learn the password, either on the 
 Domain or on the CE device, depending on which options are used.  Use
 this with care.


 See the telnetd sample for an example of how to use this API.
